# Social Network API

## Description

In this repository, you'll discover the code for a cutting-edge NoSQL-based API designed for a dynamic social network web application. The API empowers users to share their thoughts, react to their friends' thoughts, and manage their friend lists efficiently.

The foundation of this API is built upon Express.js, a robust framework for handling routing. MongoDB serves as the powerful NoSQL database, enabling flexible data storage. To enhance data modeling, the Mongoose ODM is employed, providing a seamless interface between the application and the database.

By leveraging a wide range of HTTP methods, the API adeptly handles Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations for users, thoughts, reactions, and friend lists. With this sophisticated API at your disposal, you can create a vibrant social network platform with ease.

# Getting Started

To run the API locally, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that MongoDB is installed on your machine. Refer to the MongoDB installation guide for instructions on how to set it up locally.

2. Clone this repository to your local machine.

3. Install the required dependencies using npm.

4. Configure the MongoDB connection by modifying the .env file and providing the appropriate values for your MongoDB server.

5. Start the server using the npm start

The server should now be running locally on http://localhost:3001. You can use API testing tools like Insomnia or Postman to interact with the available routes.
